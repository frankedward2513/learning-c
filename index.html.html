        <h2>I. Expectations</h2>
        <p>
            I expect this course to deepen my knowledge of the IT industry, especially in web mastery, and to help improve both my professional and personal growth. I hope the course will be enjoyable and not overly difficult in terms of exams, quizzes, and activities. I also expect the tools and techniques to be easy to understand so they can be applied effectively in real-life situations. My goal is for everyone in the class to pass the course with a grade of at least 80. Most importantly, I hope to finish this course with valuable learning experiences and good memories.

        <h2>II. Motivations</h2>
        <p>
            My main motivation is my family and my future family. I want to improve our quality of life and overcome poverty. I am motivated to become a knowledgeable and skilled IT professional. I also want to help other people, especially those in need such as the homeless. Achieving financial stability will allow me to buy what I want and travel around the world. Lastly, I am motivated to build my confidence and become the best version of myself.

        <h2>III. Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            To attain my goals in this course, I will take detailed notes and engage in self-study to better understand each topic. I will ask the instructor or my classmates whenever I feel confused. I will complete and submit all activities on time and attend classes regularly. I will strive to be a responsible student by recognizing my limitations and managing them properly. I will also actively participate in class by sharing my ideas, skills, and knowledge.

        <h2>IV. Hindrances</h2>
        <p>
            Some factors may hinder me from achieving my goals in this course, such as spending time playing volleyball and playing online games like Mobile Legends. Managing household chores is also challenging since I live alone in my apartment. Distractions from watching videos on TikTok, YouTube, and TV can affect my focus. Poor internet connection that causes lag or choppy access may interfere with online learning. Additionally, having many activities from other courses can make time management difficult.
